## [Linear Regression](https://github.com/justinezth/Machine-Learning-in-R-Projects/blob/master/Linear_Regression_Bikes.ipynb)
Played around Bike Sharing Demand Data from [Kaggle's Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data). Tried to predict total number of rentals, but through data analysis, learned that linear regression isn't the best model for this data because of the seasonal and time series nature of the data.

## [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/justinezth/Machine-Learning-in-R-Projects/blob/master/Logistic_Regression.ipynb)
Used logistic regression to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year using [UCI's Adult Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).

## [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/justinezth/Machine-Learning-in-R-Projects/blob/master/KNN.ipynb)
Practiced choosing K value for K-Nearest Neighbors model on the iris data.

## [Decision Trees & Random Forests](https://github.com/justinezth/Machine-Learning-in-R-Projects/blob/master/trees.ipynb)
Classify schools as Private or Public based off their features using the College data frame from ISLR.

## [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/justinezth/Machine-Learning-in-R-Projects/blob/master/SVM.ipynb)
Use public lending data from Lending Club from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.

## [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/justinezth/Machine-Learning-in-R-Projects/blob/master/KMeans_Clustering.ipynb)
Added a label to the a combined data set of [UCI's Red and White Wine Data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/) to see how well we can cluster the wine into groups.

## [Neural Nets](https://github.com/justinezth/Machine-Learning-in-R-Projects/blob/master/Neural_Nets.ipynb)
Predict whether or not a Bank Note was authentic with [UCI's Banknote Authentication Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).
